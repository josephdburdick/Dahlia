								h2 Synopsis
								p Mandy gets ready to leave her husband, Noel, after 3 years of being in an abusive relationship with him. She holds her baby Ali and picks up her bags when she hears Noel coming home early. When he realizes what is happening Mandy faces the most dangerous moment of her life. Memories of her past come to her mind and she suffers from what might be the most violent outbreak she’s been through. Will Mandy succeed in the battle against her fears, love and husband’s fist?
						.col-sm-6
								h2 Our approach
								p Our goal is to dive into Mandy’s psychology in such depth that when we show her memories the viewer feels the way she felt. This means understanding her attraction and relationship with Noel by being seduced by his charm when they meet, emphasizing with his vulnerabilities, and ending up trapped in an unhealthy relationship. 
								p We take our role as filmmakers in society very responsibly and want to make a piece that will make a difference in creating awareness about this subject in the most accurate way we can.
