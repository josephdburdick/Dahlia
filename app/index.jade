							| I am a filmmaker/producer based in NYC. I work  in all types of audiovisual
							| productions including Narrative Films, Documentaries, Music Videos and Commercials.

						p
							| Originally a business woman, I studied Business Administration in the American
							| University of Paraguay and specialized in Business Management in the
							| Ecole Supérieure de Commerce de Montpellier in  France. I also have a diploma in
							| Performing Arts and Filmmaking from the New York Film Academy.

						p
							| I dedicated the first half of my career to project management and consulting in
							| different fields such as Non-Profit, Advertising and Commercial. I got additional
							| training through intensive workshops and business seminars in fields that would
							| make me the best leader and communicator such as coaching, leadership, writing,
							| speech, etiquette, and customer service.

						p
							| I was introduced to filmmaking while shooting a commercial for a client. I fell
							| in love with the production process and realized the power of this communication
							| tool. Since then I have been through almost all departments including Directing,
							| AD, Camera, Lighting, Grip, Sound and Production. Combining my solid technical,
							| managerial and communication skills with my innate creativity I am now a unique
							| asset for any audiovisual project.
